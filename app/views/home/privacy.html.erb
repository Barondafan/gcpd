        <p>Our privacy policy is simple and does not require a lawyer 
          to understand it. If you have sensitive information that you don't want us to 
          share with the world, then keep it to yourself -- don't tell us. We may
          be the police but you are not safe. 
          <br><br>
          It's really that simple.
